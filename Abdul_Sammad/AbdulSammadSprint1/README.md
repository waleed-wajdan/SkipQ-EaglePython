# Welcome to the Hello world Lambda Function Using CDK

## What is this?

This is a sample Hello world Lambda Function Using CDK.

## What is CDK?

AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. You can use AWS CDK to define cloud resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and AWS Lambda functions.

## What is Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

## What is the purpose of this project?
