# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a HelloWorldLambda Project with Python for Training Sprint 1.

The `HelloWordLambda.py` file contains the function that is to be executed

The `training_sprint1_stack.py` file contains the class that defines our construct.

`aws_lambda.Function` command is used to build the stack

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.
