## Purpose

In this sprint, I have done following tasks:
* Create pipelines
* Add beta and prod stages to the pipeline
* Deploy the pipeline
* Write 5 unit tests
* Write functional test
* Add unit test step in the beta stage
* Add manual approval step before the prod stage
* Create two metrics (duration and errors) for lambda web health
* Create alarms on those metrics
* Configure auto rollback if any of the metrics are in alarm
