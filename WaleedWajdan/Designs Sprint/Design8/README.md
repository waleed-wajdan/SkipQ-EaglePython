## Task

You are a DevOps engineer working at a big tech company and your manager has given you a task to migrate a three-tier PHP-based monolithic application to microservices. Consider the scenario that the application is running on a EC2 server with ALB in front of it. Now design an E2E architecture that would containerize the application.

Expectation:

How the application would be migrated to microservices

Need a running application of container based services

The application should have an E2E CI/CD pipeline that would build the application and deploy the updated code/manifest on the container-based services

Design the above architecture in draw.io
